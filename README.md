# Titanic-Survival-Guess-Model
Developed a machine learning model to analyze and predict passenger survival on the Titanic using Python.

Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and handled missing values in the dataset.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualized survival trends based on gender, class, age, and fare.
Feature Engineering: Created new features and transformed categorical data for better model performance.
Model Building: Implemented and compared multiple machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest.
Evaluation: Assessed model accuracy and fine-tuned parameters for improved predictions.
